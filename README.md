# dmenu - dynamic menu

My own fork of dmenu, an efficient dynamic menu for X.

# Patches

- [xresources alt](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xresources-alt/) : load font and colors from ~/.Xresources
- [reject-no-match](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/reject-no-match/) : pass `-r` to dmenu to reject input that doesn't match anything

# Installation

```sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
